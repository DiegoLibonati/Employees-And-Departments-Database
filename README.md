I made a database in order to practice SQL. I was able to make a database about different employees working in different departments. In addition I could create tables, assign fields to that table with their respective data types, insert information to the tables, delete tables, make queries to it like: select, select \*, select distinct, select + order by, select + where, select as, select with conditions, select with mathematical operations, select + group by, select + having, count etc.
